# REST Client Workplace for VS Code

A simple workplace directory for the Visual Studio Code [REST Client] extension to be used in VS Code workspaces with multiple repositories.

When working with multiple REST APIs, this workplace helps to prepare and store HTTP requests in a centralized place without littering the individual repositories with `*.http` or `*.rest` files and preventing possible source-control file issues.

Additionally, the workplace holds an `example.http` file with basic examples how to use the [REST Client] extension (mostly inspired by the extension's description).

Feel free to fork this repo and use is it as a private store for your workspace-specific http requests.
